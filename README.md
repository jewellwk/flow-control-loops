### Lab 1: Guess the Number

**Word Problem:**  
Create a number-guessing game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 10, and the user has 3 attempts to guess the number.

**Instructions:**  
1. Use `random.randint(1, 10)` to generate a random number.
2. Create a loop that allows the user to guess the number up to 3 times.
3. After each guess, tell the user whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. If the user guesses the number or runs out of attempts, print an appropriate message.

**Concepts Used:**  
- `input()`, `while` loop, `if-else` statement, `import random`, flow control

### Lab 3: Sum of Numbers

**Word Problem:**  
Write a program that asks the user for a number and calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to that number.

**Instructions:**  
1. Ask the user to input a number.
2. Use a `for` loop to sum the numbers from 1 to the userâ€™s input number.
3. Print the total sum.

**Concepts Used:**  
- `input()`, `for` loop, summing
